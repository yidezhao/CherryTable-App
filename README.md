# Cheery Table
Cheery Table aims to bring transparancy into donation and charity. We do so by letting users to track their donation history and require organization to update the status occasionally. The users can log into the Android App and make donation. The Organization can log into the web and make requests.

I've contributed to this group project in several aspects: \
For the Android app, 1. I wrote the Donation tab which tracks the status of the donation, the main feature of the app. 2. I connect everything to the MongoDB through Node.js (RESTful API). \
For the Web, I created the whole frame work with react (HTML & CSS & Javascript) being front end and Node.js being back end.

## NOTE
This is a group project done for CIS350 Software Engineer at the University of Pennsylvania. Thank Chuning Zhu, Yuewei Yuan, Matthew Jortberg, and Liyang Zhou for their respective contribution to the project.
